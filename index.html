    <h1>The haunted house</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
     <p>
    This is the name which a certain property between 3 de Febrero street and Av. Gdor. Freyre goes by. It was built over 90 years ago and many inexplicable events have been happening there for years now. The construction started in the first part of XX century (between 1920 and 1930). It was one of the so-called “cheap” houses, due to its low rental cost. That entire area of the neighbourhood was for the workers of the old Mitre Station railroad. </p>
    <p>
    The property has been uninhabited for many years and is now up for sale. The old mansion, built in French architectural style, has two balconies, a portico, and an outdoor patio. But the passage of time and lack of maintenance are taking their toll. It has had several owners, but tragedy began to haunt the place in the 1970s. Strange noises, ghostly beings, and lights that turn on and off by themselves are recurring episodes in the house. </p>

      <h2>Where did it all start?</h2>
        <p>
        The official story says that a family with several children moved there. Two of them were twins. One day, while their mother was bathing one of them, the brother went out onto the sidewalk to ride his tricycle. At one point, he went down to the street, just as a truck was speeding by. </p>
        <p>
        Trucks in those days were made of hard iron and were very heavy. Perhaps that is why the driver did not notice the accident and kept going until the people who witnessed the tragedy warned him. "The story goes that when the driver saw the dead child, he could not bear the guilt and began to bang his head against the chassis of the truck. He died shortly after. </p>
        <p>
        As a result of what happened, there are many myths surrounding the haunted house. “Sometimes you see a girl leaning on a railing on the second floor. Or sometimes the lights turn on by themselves and the doorbell rings.” </p>
        <p>
        Other testimonies include: </p>
        <p>
        * During the floods of 2003, a group of homeless people took refuge there but couldn't stand it and chose to return to the streets. </p>
        <p>
        * Every time builders are sent to repair it, they leave within two weeks. Working there, they said they heard whistles. </p>
        <p>
        * Someone who claims to have entered the house at night said they heard glass breaking and a babylike cry. They entered the upstairs living room, and their companion said they felt a push and fell to the ground. They also said that they felt something scratching their back. </p>

      <h2>Interviews in the neighborhood</h2>
        <p>
        There are also those who are unaware of the many legends surrounding the house. Such is the case of Rocío, the young woman who lives in the neighbouring house, who told Diario UNO that since she has lived there, she has never heard any strange noises. “We've lived here for six years. When we moved in, the house was already uninhabited”. The neighbours agreed that from time to time, the presence of a woman who sometimes comes to clean the house attracts a lot of attention. “We don't know if she's the owner, but she comes every so often. We don't understand why they keep cleaning it and maintaining it” says the girl. </p>
        <p>
        When it was rented out, people would come and stay for a month or two, according to the neighbours. "They say they heard the sound of chains and saw shadows appearing," claim other neighbours, who have lived in the neighbourhood for over 31 years. </p>

      <h2>Caminos' family</h2>
     <p>Diario UNO was able to contact Silvia Caminos, a neighbour who lived with her family in the legendary house for thirty years. She has fond memories of her time in that house, where she enjoyed her adolescence and much of her adult life. “I lived in that house from the age of 14 until I was over 40, when it was sold,” Silvia recalls. </p>
     <p>In 1958, her father, Rodolfo Caminos, decided to move in with family. Even then, rumours about ghosts were circulating. So much so that the city's Spiritualist Centre offered to perform a cleansing of the house to remove the ghosts. “My dad thanked them, but argued that he had a large number of children who would take care of scaring them away,” added Silvia. Her family consisted of her parents and, at that time, seven siblings of different ages. </p>
     <p>As in every family, there are happy memories and there are those that are not very pleasant to remember, but they happened nonetheless. The death of one of her brothers caused enormous pain to the members of the Caminos family. The boy died in 1968 at the age of nine, victim of a traffic accident. "It was a terrible accident; he was run over by a truck on Zavalla Boulevard. </p>
     <p>Regarding the legends that circulate about the house, she says she does not understand the origin of so much mystery. “I find it funny, all the things that are said about the house, because we don't hear anything. Neither did the friends we invited over,” she says. </p>
     <p>At the same time, she affirms that the only noises that could be heard on occasion were the creaking of the wooden furniture in the house, which logically produced those sounds. Far from attributing it to a paranormal event, the residents of the house took it as something natural. </p>
     <p>Silvia and her family enjoyed many beautiful and happy moments there. However, after her parents died in 1987, they decided to sell the house and each of the siblings went their separate ways. “We moved away when our parents died, but the truth is that we were all happy there,” she adds. Large gatherings, afternoons filled with people, afternoon tea, laughter, and music are just some of the scenes this woman describes today, who in a way felt nostalgic about having to leave the house.</p>
